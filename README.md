# Information-System-CRUD
An information system of the company is to be built with Python Flask and SQLite to provide aesthetic and functional features for using the software in managing company-related data. 
This is achieved through several features local business details, contacts, sale pipelines, tasks, and email log documents are stored in an SQLite database. 
For the backend, Flask is used where the routing, form handling, and session to authenticate users are made easy. To this end, incorporating a JSON API as a new feature enables users to utilize the system programmatically for data access and modification. 
This system helps prevent the time delay in getting the business data where it is required most in the process flow in terms of analysis and management.
